The backend was made on Django and front end on React

8. [Magnetiq](./8_MAGNETIQ.md)
A platform where brands can come and convert their assets into magnets (NFT) and then can schedule them of release in future. With a magnet comes benefits that the buyer can avail like being a part of community, a ticket to something, raffel or just anything. This way the user gets a practical and quite useful NFT and the brand gets the community, promotion of its new launchs. The whole process is automated and gives a complete web2 experience to the user from payments to web3 transactions to creating users custodial wallets. The project is build using Flow Blockchain and Django (Python) framework and the brands contracts were automatically created and deployed on chain where each magnet had its own unique smart contract.
