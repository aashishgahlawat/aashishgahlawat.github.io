# BESOL

We built an end-to-end web application for a NY-based Asset Management and Financial Services client to automate their loan underwriting process. Built on the popular python based Django framework, the web application consists of a multi-user web portal, an automated loan underwriting system, as well as integrations with proprietary third-party data sources. It comes with the requisite security infrastructure, to provide loan underwriting services seamlessly and instantaneously.
